# Minecraft Modding Docs

The purpose of these docs is to document not very well documented versions of Minecraft Modding, like RetroMCP and the Modloader and PS3 Minecraft Modding.

If you would like to add to the docs, do so at [This Github Repo](https://github.com/LimeGradient/RetroMCP-Docs/tree/docs)
